Next step is to fill the "Add new application" form. Here you need to enter the information such as the title of your app, its website, type (game, fun, office, productivity and other are possible) and description. **Note**: Fields "Title" and "Type" are mandatory, others are optional.

Click on app title to view/edit its credentials.

You will see the auto-generated values of the **application id**, **authorization key** and **authorization secret**. These are important - your app needs to use these credentials so that server knows who's there. Also, go to [https://admin.quickblox.com/account/settings](https://admin.quickblox.com/account/settings) and copy your **account id**.

**Note**: You may also see modules icons: **Chat, Users, Push Notifications, Content, Custom Objects, Location** - feel free to click on them and experiment with admin panels for those features.
